# Try to beat this sophisticated approach to analyzing your Rock-Paper-Scissors patterns!
This code helps you to play the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, with a twist.


### Code Requirements
1. You will need either Anaconda or Python3.
2. pip install requirements.txt
3. Allow webcam access to your preferred code execution application


### Description
Rock–paper–scissors (also known as scissors-paper-rock or other variants) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (aka "victory" or "peace sign") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.


### Rules
Scissors cuts Paper --> Paper covers Rock --> Rock crushes Scissors 


### Functionalities
1) Filters to detect hand.
2) CNN for training the model.


### Python  Implementation - Hand detection
1) Network Used - Convolutional Neural Network


### Implementation - For CPU to defeat User
1) Our own logic


### Procedure
Just run 'RPS_App.py' for playing Rock-Paper-Scissors via webcam.
